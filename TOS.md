# RoChat Terms of Service

**Last updated: January 2026**

Hey there! Thanks for checking out RoChat. Before you use it, here's what you're agreeing to - written in plain English, not lawyer-speak.

## What is RoChat?

RoChat is an open-source chat app (MIT License) that aims to replace Roblox's limited chat system with per-server messaging. It's currently in **alpha** - meaning it's not fully functional yet and things might break.

## The Basics

By using RoChat, you agree to:

- **Be decent** - Don't harass, spam, or be toxic to other users
- **Keep it legal** - Don't use RoChat for anything illegal or against Roblox's TOS
- **Be patient** - This is alpha software made by real people, not a corporation

## What You Should Know

### It's Alpha Software
- Features may not work
- Bugs will happen
- Things might change without notice
- We might need to wipe data during development

### Your Messages
Storage: **we don't plan to store or read your messages** long-term. However, during this development and testing phase, messages may be temporarily saved on our servers to debug issues. If you're sharing something sensitive, maybe don't put it in chat while we're still in alpha.

### Open Source
RoChat is MIT licensed. You can view, fork, and modify the code. If you find bugs or want to contribute, you're welcome to.

### No Guarantees
We provide RoChat "as is." We can't promise:
- It'll always work
- Your data won't be lost
- The service will always be available
- It won't have bugs
- It will not expose any information
- It will secure any data

### Your Roblox Account
RoChat uses Roblox authentication. We don't store your Roblox password. But you're responsible for your own account security.

## Don't Do These Things

- Don't try to break or exploit the app
- Don't impersonate others
- Don't spam or flood chats
- Don't share malware or harmful links
- Don't use bots or automated tools without permission

## We Can

- Ban users who break these rules
- Modify or shut down the service
- Change these terms (we'll try to give notice)
