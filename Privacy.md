# RoChat Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 2026**

We're not going to bore you with pages of legal text. Here's what we actually do with your data.

## The Short Version

- We collect minimal data to make the app work
- We don't sell your data
- We don't want to spy on you
- This is alpha software, so some data logging happens for debugging

## What We Collect

### Account Info
- Your Roblox username and user ID (from Roblox OAuth)
- Your Profile Picture

### Chat Messages
- Messages you send through RoChat
- Which server/game you're in when you send them

### Technical Stuff
- Basic logs to help us debug when things break
- Connection info to route messages properly

## What We DON'T Collect

- Your Roblox password (we use official Roblox OAuth)
- Your location
- Personal info beyond your Roblox username

## How We Use Your Data

- **Messages**: To deliver them to other users in your server/game
- **Username**: To show who sent what message
- **PlaceID/JobID**: Data collected from roblox logs, To make chats and sync you with the correct one
- **Logs**: To fix bugs and improve the app

## Important: Alpha Development Notice

**During this alpha phase, your messages and activity may be logged and temporarily stored for debugging purposes.** We need to see what's happening to fix issues. Once RoChat is stable, we plan to minimize data retention.

If you're uncomfortable with this, we totally understand - maybe wait until we hit a stable release.

## Data Storage

- Messages are stored temporarily on our servers
- We enforce a 50-message limit per chat to keep things minimal
- Old messages get automatically deleted

## Third Parties

- **Roblox**: We use their OAuth for login. Their privacy policy applies to their services.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Our database provider. Your data sits on their servers.

We don't share or sell your data to advertisers or anyone else.

## Your Rights

You can:
- Stop using RoChat anytime
- Ask us what data we have on you
- Request deletion of your data

Just reach out through our GitHub.

## Security

We try to keep things secure, but no system is perfect - especially alpha software. Don't share super sensitive info through any chat app, including ours.

## Changes

We might update this policy as the app develops. We'll try to announce significant changes.

## Open Source

RoChat is MIT licensed. You can review exactly what the code does yourself. Transparency through open source.

## Questions?

Check the GitHub repo or open an issue. We're a community project, not a faceless corporation.

*Last thing: by using RoChat, you're accepting this privacy policy. If something here doesn't sit right with you, that's okay - just don't use the app until you're comfortable with it.*
